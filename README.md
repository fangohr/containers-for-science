# Containers for science

Introduction to use of containers for computational science and data analysis, with focus on key (Docker) container features.

# How to read the document

The repository can be downloaded from https://github.com/fangohr/containers-for-science/archive/master.zip

The subdirectory `pdf` contains a pdf version of the document (also [available here](https://github.com/fangohr/containers-for-science/raw/master/pdf/containers-for-science.pdf))

The subdirectory `html` contains a html version of the document.

The subdirectory `notebooks` contains one Jupyter Notebook per chapter. (Useful to step through the examples interactively.)

# Work in progress

12/2019:

- there is a [mybinder branch](https://github.com/fangohr/containers-for-science/tree/mybinder) which aims to allow execution of these notebooks on binder. Not quite finished yet (contributions welcome)

- would be nice to have a similar introduction to Singularity containers
